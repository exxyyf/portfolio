# Portfolio
These are some of the projects I've created during my studies 
| Project title | Description | Packages
| -------- | ------- |----------
| Age prediction  | In this project I trained ResNet50 on APPA-REAL dataset in order to predict age of the customers| Tensorflow, keras, numpy, pandas
| Comment moderation | I trained some linear models and gradient boosting models on word embeddings, which I created using pre-trained Toxic-BERT, for binary classification of comments. They could be either offensive or neutral| Tensorflow, nltk, BERT, huggingfaces, numpy, LightGBM, CatBoost, Scikit-Learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
|Car price prediction|I performed EDA and trained some regression models on dataset with more than 100 thousand car purchase performed deals|Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, LightGBM, CatBoost, Scikit-Learn
|Taxi demand prediction| Here I worked with time-series data: first part is the trend and seasonal analysis, second part is the demand prediction using linear regression and boosting models| Statsmodels, pandas, numpy, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, CatBoost
